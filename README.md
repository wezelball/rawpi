# Project Title

Rawpy - Radio Astronomy With Python
A suite of command-line applications for performing radio telescope observations and post-processing data.

## Description
Rawpy consists of multiple command-line applications to perform both spectral and total power observations. Recorded data can be despiked, filtered, smoothed, and plotted.  Future versions will allow PDF resport output, and control of noise source calibration via USB relay.

The prorgam is still in early stages, but it is basically functional.  This README is definitely not finished, so don't pay much attention to it yet.  I will add to it later, after the code is further along.
